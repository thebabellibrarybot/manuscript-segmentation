 INFO ABT THE STUFF
 


CWD:

data_prep.py: 

calls prep_utils and mask_maker in the data prep directory of the src  directory. Either splits an image and csv folder with all orgin info into a test and train dir and then precedes rto organize the training information inwith the several outputs found in mask_mker. OR given specific instructions will only preform a part of these functions on information in the data/img_orgin folder, data/img_orgin/Test folder, or data/img_orgin/Train folder

	returns:

	CWD/SRC/data_prep:

		Prep_utils:
		
		preforms skipy test train split on image and csv annotations and saves them to 			the disk so that each new directory can be independanlty referenced.
		
		Mask_mker:
		
		preforms tranformations to input image data and saves it to the diskk. used to 			create ground truth training data from csv annotation in order to train a custom 			model for semantic segmentation tasks.

train.py:

call on iscripts from the src/train/ folder. used for laoding, training and showing some training visualizations for training a sematic segmentation model from the resnet50 weights using a deeplabv3 nn.

	args:
	returns:
	- model.torch to to be saved to disk for preds
	- plt with train and eval plt
